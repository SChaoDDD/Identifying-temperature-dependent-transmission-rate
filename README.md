Our code is composed of three programming languages, each achieving distinct outcomes. 
Julia is used to implement the fitting of ILI cases and infection rates using UDE (Universal Differential Equations), as well as symbolic regression. 
R is employed to perform causal inference with CCM (Convergent Cross Mapping) and ECCM (Extended Convergent Cross Mapping), along with the implementation of DLNM (Distributed Lag Nonlinear Models).
Matlab is utilized for solving ODE models, including model fitting, prediction, and migration.
